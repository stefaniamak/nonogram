# 🧩 Nonogram Solver & Puzzle Designer

A full-featured nonogram solver and puzzle creation tool built as part of my university thesis. This project combines **heuristic optimization**, **responsive UI**, and **interactive puzzle design** — all inside a clean and intuitive user experience.

Users can design their own nonogram puzzles or visualize the solving process step by step, with complete control and real-time feedback.

## 🧠 Features

• Solve complex nonogram puzzles using optimized heuristic algorithms  
• Create puzzles by drawing directly on the grid or inputting clues manually  
• Step-by-step solving slider with visual feedback  
• Real-time puzzle validation and interactive error handling  
• Responsive, mobile-friendly layout and intuitive UX  
• Smooth performance using isolates and workers to offload heavy computations

## ⚙️ Technical Highlights

• Heuristic algorithm reduced solving time from 9 minutes to ~1 second  
• Recursive logic and constraint satisfaction techniques for puzzle validation  
• Use of Flutter **Isolate** and **Flutter Worker** to keep the UI responsive  
• Manual clue input + draw-your-own grid generation  
• RegEx-powered validation for puzzle integrity  
• Visual, step-by-step solving slider with animated transitions
